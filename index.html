                                    <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>As I mentioned in CENSURF 3, I wanted to adopt a partial living style of a Baha’i. Perhaps once a week, I would try to say a short prayer at noon. The time commitment of saying short prayers isn’t just the 30 seconds of praying. It requires me to periodically check time to make sure I haven’t missed it. Every time I do that though, my train of thoughts gets interrupted so it will take me more time to concentrate again. I know from the reading that Baha’is treat their faith seriously. Therefore, to mimic the behavior of a Baha’i, I can extrapolate the amount of commitment an actual practicing Baha’i would need and have a more personal understanding of the religion.</p>
<p>I will be attending graduate school in a much diverse city, in either Ann Arbor or Boston. If I live in Ann Arbor, I hope to visit the North American House of Worship outside of Chicago. In a school of 30,000 students, and under two hours away from Chicago, I am confident to find a Baha’i community on campus. This way, I hope to continue fighting against the stereotypes that Chinese exchange students only focus on academic achievements. I hope to show my community that I can be just as curious about religion and engage in difficult conversations about race and injustices just like Baha’is do.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, we read some excerpts on people traveling to remote locations, most in developing countries with no tourist infrastructures. After earning my master’s degree, I hope to take a year or two to travel to similar countries. It wasn’t until reading Eck and Ruf had I realize that I have been a tourist for 20 years. Watching Youtube videos of how people hitch ride trains across the Sahara Desert was pretty appealing to me. There’s no first-class, no hot prepared meals. It would just be me and whatever materials each train car is carrying. I can further understand how tiny humans are compared to Earth, and how tiny Earth is in the universe.</p>

                                    <h2 id="elizabeth">Elizabeth</h2>
<p>When Elizabeth came to our class to share her experience as a Baha’i, she mentioned that the biggest thing she grasped and eventually led her be a Baha’i is progressive revelation. It has the analogy that human history is like hiking up mountains. The big objective is to climb to the summit, but en route, there are downhills that seem to deviate us from reaching the top. After being able to use analogies to understand progressive revelation,  I have a better understanding of where others come from, and how we can engage in conversations about religion, which to some is the fundamental component of human life. <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/bahai.jpg" alt="baha&rsquo;i"></p>
<h2 id="the-road-less-traveled">The Road less traveled</h2>
<p>After class ends, I typically walk with Cole to Old Main where we go separate ways. The 5-minute conversation three times a week made me learned a lot about the two of us. We share similar habits, have similar views on some but drastically different on others. I shared how most Chinese families treat religion. Most of them are atheists, but not because of the Chinese government. Instead, coming out of WWII, we have adhered to this idea that we can rely on no one except ourselves. Nothing is certain until you do it yourself. That’s why we don’t turn to God or gods for a better life or a successful event. We would be putting all of our hope into someone that is distant and isn’t present all the time. Despite his faith, he was intrigued by what I had to say. We ended up carrying out a 10-minute conversation about it.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Every time my Christian friends talking about God over dinner, it was obvious they were trying to convert me, and I get quite annoyed. To me, analogies composed the entire Bible. Science has shown earth did not involve in nine days, so that must be an analogy. Lions ripped in half won’t produce honey, so that also must be an analogy. Whales can’t eat people and spit them back to shore alive, so that must be another analogy. That was hard for me to understand why my friends believe in abstract stories. But when we talked able Manifestations, things became a bit clearer. Analogies, like manifestations, are God’s method to connect humans to divinity. This helps humanity to better understand God. If I look at it from that perspective, I find it easier to accept why someone can trust their life into an abstract, non-physical idea.</p>
<p>Like Mormons, everyone born into a culture of religion can easily accept the religion, where outsiders find it challenging to even understand. Talking with Cole taught me to always be open to others. Even though we grew up in distinct parts of the world, we have way more in common. I mentioned to him I play video games for fun. It turns out that we both like this video game and have invested a lot of effort.<img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/lol.jpg" alt="league">
This showed me that even though our backgrounds are drastically different, we are also just college students who like video games. Our differences in politics, religion may differ, but that didn’t prevent us from discussing things we both liked, something trivial. Even on matters like religion, we still had a respectful conversation. I was able to see how religion is ingrained into him the moment he was born. It wasn’t about being exposed to, it was about being submerged in that. I was hesitant in sharing the atheist ideology with anyone because I was afraid they would think I am disrespecting their religion by saying I believe God doesn’t exist. But his response was amazing and helpful. It showed me that some people still like to engage in conversations, even if they are difficult. From that moment on, I learned to be more open on my culture and religion, if I am fairly confident that both parties can display good efforts to listen and understand each other to gave common grounds for a thoughtful discussion.</p>

                                    <h2 id="the-beach-house">The Beach House</h2>
<p>I was invited to ride around campus to deliver face masks. I talk every now and then with this person, but we aren’t close. As we were walking towards Olin to fill up the box that Boss is holding, the friend turned to me and said, “Hey, I heard others talking the other day that your parents own million-dollar homes and that’s why are you able to study abroad?” I jokingly replied that it would be nice if it were true. <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/beach.png" alt="beach house"></p>
<h2 id="mormonism-and-islam">Mormonism and Islam</h2>
<p>During the Presidential Seminar, we talked about racism and engaging across lines of difference. Someone in the class said that while there may not be a clear solution, we at least know what to not do. They continued on, by saying that China is currently avoiding engaging the differences with Muslims by suppressing them in Xinjiang Province. In my response, I pointed out that the US, a country with its founding values to have freedom of religion, went through an extensive period of religious suppression on Mormons. After Joseph Smith claimed to have spoken with God, he and his believers were driven out of their property. Local militia forms wherever Mormons resettle. I ended with the point that Christian’s suppression of Mormonism is a more appropriate example of what not to do than the Chinese’s potential suppression of Muslims, given the drastic cultural differences that exist between the two countries. <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/tag.png" alt="tag"></p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Being stereotyped to be a rich Asian came shocking to me. 10% of my high school population was made of international students, out of which 92% were Chinese exchange students. The 12 of us joined American students to merely be another group of students, representing a different region. Here at Wofford, however, I am the only Chinese student out of 2300 enrolled. So that conversation during the mask delivery let me see how I am the odd one out. People ask questions only when they are curious. They get curious when they see something they are not used to. To them, I am a Chinese student going to a school costing $60,000 a year. They also know that the living standards in China are significantly lower than that of the US, which then led them to believe that my parents are far above average in China. In fact, however, many exchange students are not wealthy. Choosing Wofford with its scholarships for me over other schools actually was the cheapest option. I am confident that the student who asked me meant no harm, and none was taken. I just saw a clear line of difference in what others believe and the reality and appreciated that conversation.</p>
<p><code>Well, I Wasn’t Expecting.</code></p>
<p>After my rebuttal to show the issues in comparing China’s religious suppression and racism in the US, some students came up to me and thought I had a very good point. They were also surprised that I knew the details of a historical period on Mormonism. I asked them why, most just said, “well I wasn’t expecting.” I thought over and over exactly what do they mean, and came to the conclusion that given the current events of the world, they must think China places a huge restriction on religion. Therefore, they weren’t expecting me to know much about Christianity or even become interested in it. I never thought anyone will think of me that way. Wofford has a long history of religious associations and all of its students can be just as interested in it. In fact, I would say I am fairly interested in religion. My religion credit was satisfied by Dr. Anderson’s Religion and Medicine class. This class is my opportunity to learn more about religions and their different values before diving deep into Computer Science at graduate school. This was a remarkable experience that shows me a very different version of me from others point of view. At multiple points, I kept saying, “so THIS is what others think of me.” I am happy in the sense that I have a clearer understanding of others but more so about my actions which were able to at least change some of their opinions.</p>

                                    <h2 id="nashville">Nashville</h2>
<p>Throughout the semester, I found out how my background was drastically different than everyone else. One of the roll call topics, which I still think is our best topic, is to “say something others would not know about you.” One of our classmates said that she is a contracted Disney Plus and Amazon actress. When I heard about it, my first reaction was “nice! Good for her!” While the rest of the class were more along the lines of “That is so cool! It’s crazy.” This made me realize that to most people, actresses and celebrities are distant figures. It just so happens that my personal experience has made me come in contact with some supposed distant figures.</p>
<p>I went to high school with Myles Moore, who plays Jake Maitland in the music drama tv series named <em>Nashville</em>. This is a picture of us in the same prom group. <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/myles_prom.png" alt="prom Myles"></p>
<p>Like Myles, another celebrity that went to my school is Zion Williamson, who is currently a power forward for the New Orleans Pelicans. This is a picture of the majority of our senior graduating class during the state championship (can you spot me?). <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/zion_game.png" alt="zion game"></p>
<h2 id="the-suez-canal">The Suez Canal</h2>
<p>On March 23, a Panama flagged, Japanese-owned cargo ship Ever Given was grounded in the waterway of the Suez Canal. This blockage caused a major disruption in world trade. However terrible the event is, when I first heard about the incident, my first reaction was “imagine if this was a Chinese operated cargo ship.” <img src="https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/canal.png" alt="ever given"></p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Neither of the pictures I have with the celebrity or actor is singles — pictures of just me and the person. Going to classes every day, I was used to the fact that they go to my school. I treat them like classmates and friends rather than famous people. However, that is because of the environment I was in. Everyone in the school was used to it. No one is making a special deal out of it. When I left that environment, the fact of living with celebrities is no longer a common theme. Thus, everyone reacted with excitement and was surprised by that. Knowing that this religion class is a fair representation of Wofford’s community with majors across the discipline, seeing my classmates’ reactions showed how unique my own background was.</p>
<p>As a Chinese national, I was very upset when internet users made unfounded claims that COVID-19 was manufactured by Chinese authorities. These claims still exist even after the WHO investigators concluded that the development of the virus was extremely unlikely to be artificially cultured. Regardless of the facts, many people fear that China will one day again become powerful, threatening other countries’ positions on the international level. This is made China a scapegoat. Because of the world’s point of view on China currently, and given my status in the US as an exchange student, my gut response was if China owned the cargo ship, the world would connect this to COVID-19 and construe a larger conspiracy. That immediate response came from my background. I realized that the context in which shaped me to be an easier target for something way out of anyone’s control. I compared to another concern that only a certain group of people worry about. Females are more hesitant to walk across parking lots at night, whereas males are much less concerned. Being shaped as women by nature simply put them into more harm’s way; being shaped from China, in today’s society, puts us in the center of blame.</p>
